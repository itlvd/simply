# Members

This is an awesome features of Ghost. If you want to make money with publications, you can use Membership features of Ghost.

## Portal

Go in your Ghost's `dashboard -> Settings -> Membership -> Portal Settings`

By default, Simply uses Portal for member management. If you prefer, Simply also comes with individual pages to support the membership function.

> If you want to use with individual pages let me know. I will create a more functional version.
